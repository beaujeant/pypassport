	* Secure Messaging (SM)
	* Active Authentication (AA)
	* Passive Authentication (PA)


## Example

Here is an example to read the DG1 and save the picture.

```
from pypassport import reader
from pypassport import epassport
from pypassport import jp2converter

my_mrz = "1234567897BEL9001022M3003046<<<<<<<<<<<<<<00"

my_reader = reader.ReaderManager().getReader()
my_passport = epassport.EPassport(my_reader, my_mrz)

datagroup_one = my_passport["DG1"]

print("Nationality:", datagroup_one["5F2C"].decode())
print("Name:", datagroup_one["5F5B"].decode())

datagroup_two = my_passport["DG2"]

with open("profile.bmp", "wb") as f:
    f.write(jp2converter.convertJp2(datagroup_two["A1"]["5F2E"]))
```


## Installation

The pypassport package uses distutils for installation:

```
git clone https://github.com/beaujeant/pypassport.git
cd pypassport
python setup.py install
```


## Requirements

* pyscard
* pycryptodome
* pyasn1
* PIL

At the moment pyPassport handle generic PCSC readers. Passport reading have been successfully performed with the following smartcard readers:

* ACS ACR 122.


## Authors

pyPassport was initially developped by Jean-Francois Houzard and Olivier Roger (formerly) from the Information Security Group of the Univeristy of Louvain-La-Neuve. Later, Antonin Beaujeant joined the development team to improve the library and implement new features.
